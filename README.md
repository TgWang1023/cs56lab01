# STARTER_lab01

Starter code for [lab01](https://ucsb-cs56-m18.github.io/lab/lab01/) for UCSB CS56 M18

You should edit this README.md file to include a link to your javadoc instead of this javadoc:

* Javadoc: https://github.com/TgWang1023/cs56lab01/tree/master/docs/javadoc

Also, include the names and github ids of you and your pair partner if you work in a pair.

Be sure your own repo is of the form https://github.com/ucsb-cs56-m18/lab01-githubid1-githubid2 with the two github ids in alphabetical order.

If approved by your mentor to work as a single programmer, or in a trio, please adjust the instructions as appropriate.

Make sure your pair partner(s) is/are added as a collaborator(s).
